# Simple WebAPP
1. Create a Complete WebSerice Application (Python-Flask-APP) as Salt-Formula.
2. deploy it on Salt-minion, so salt-Minion should run that Salt-Formula.

# Graphana Formula
1. There is graphana Formula available in hte salt-stack repo. 
2. use that and Deploy it somewhere. 

# SaltStack's SaltStack-salt-formula:

Need to Explore this, how this can be Formed?

# use Django Formula and Deploy it on single and multiple Stakcs!!

# SaltCloud

So Final thing. 

I have created One Salt-master on my Local-System, 
using salt-cloud I have created VM's on Following clouds. 

Without even opening any Cloud-Console!


1. AWS
Extending Profiles:
https://docs.saltproject.io/en/latest/topics/cloud/config.html#amazon-aws

2. Azure
3. Linode
4. Rackspace
5. Open-nebula


# So my understanding is, there could be one complete Python-project built using Salt-Python-API
# all the things like how salt-master is talking to salt-minions and How salt minions are being managed, upScaled, Down-Scaled
# configured and what not is being happened from that Python-stack it self, 
# It is like Python-project is built-over the Salt-Stack!!!
